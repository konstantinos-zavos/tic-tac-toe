// In short, break the big problem down and solve each of the smaller problems
//  until youâ€™ve solved the big problem.

// Show player's turn
// Object has player's names
// Function acesses object and prints player's name on screen depending on turn

// Show which player's turn it is in the top of the game board
// PLayer 1 clicks on the board
// X mark appears on the gameboard
// Now it is player's 2 turn
// Change active player's name on top of screen
// Player 2 inputs his mark into the desired space and it appears
// Now its players 1 turn again
// Repeat until victory
